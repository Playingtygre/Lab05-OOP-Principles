## Create A Zoo
One of the thing that make C# such a powerful language is the fact that we have object oriented programming. In object oriented programming we have classes. We can have many classes do many different things. One of the ways we are learning is to build out a Zoo which makes a hierarchy class

## Overview
Build out a structure of a zoo within Visual Studio and a digital diagram.
Examples are used to under-stand classes in C#.

<li> Inheritance - One of the main pillars of object oriented programming, closely matches derived
Think of a parent giving a child blue eyes and black hair. The child inherits the items from the parent.

<li> Polymorphism - Another pillar of object oriented, instead of direct inheritence can pick an choose which methods and properties 
to have. Class shapes can decide to adopt items of properties from derived classes but dont have to. Take for instance a class shape that has the values x,y,z. So the next class triangle has the ability to have x y z, but the Circle has only choosen to use the cordinates y instead. This is called virtual methods. 

<li> Abstraction -Pillar of Ojbect Oriented programming, classes can inherit later on but must be filled out by each class, Say for instance for the parent child that if a parent has blue eyes, and is 6 feet tall. The Child of that abstraction class carries the 6 feet tall jeans and needs to be 6 feet tall.
  
<li> Ecapsulation -> last pillar of Objec Oriented Programming; security apect of it these are protected pillars of the; This has protected, private, public, protected private, internal, and protected internal.
